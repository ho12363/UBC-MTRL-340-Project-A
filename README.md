### *ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF GAS TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENTS: LITERATURE REVIEW AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES*
1. The turbine is the part of the gas turbine engine that receives the hot air from the combustion chamber and expands it to the outside. As the air that comes into the turbine is at high temperature, turbine materials must sustain this. Because of the stresses of this high temperature on the turbine blades, turbine materials become damaged through creep mechanisms, thermal fatigue and environmental attack.

2. The fact that turbine blades have very complex shapes and are primarily vulnerable to high-temperature operation means that high-performance materials with special manufacturing routes are used

### *Advances in nickel-based cast superalloys*
1. Nickel-based superalloy with FCC (γ) matrix and ordered FCC (γ′) coherent precipitates has proved to be the right candidate to meet the challenging combination of properties.
