### *ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF GAS TURBINE ENGINE COMPONENTS: LITERATURE REVIEW AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES*
1. The turbine is the part of the gas turbine engine that receives the hot air from the combustion chamber and expands it to the outside. As the air that comes into the turbine is at high temperature, turbine materials must sustain this. Because of the stresses of this high temperature on the turbine blades, turbine materials become damaged through creep mechanisms, thermal fatigue and environmental attack.

2. The fact that turbine blades have very complex shapes and are primarily vulnerable to high-temperature operation means that high-performance materials with special manufacturing routes are used

### *Advances in nickel-based cast superalloys*
1. Nickel-based superalloy with FCC (γ) matrix and ordered FCC (γ′) coherent precipitates has proved to be the right candidate to meet the challenging combination of properties.

***Novel casting processes for single-crystal turbine blades of superalloys***
1. Nibased superalloys are the preferred material for turbine blades given their high temperature strength, microstructural stability, and corrosion resistance.
2. Casting methods have been improved from conventional investment casting, which produces an equiaxed (EQ)-grain structure, to directional solidification (DS), which produces columnar-grain (CG) and singlecrystal (SC) structures.
3. In the case of rotor blades where the primary stress axis is along the length of the blade, aligning grains along the stress direction can improve creep rupture life, creep rupture ductility, and thermal fatigue resistance.

4. The wax assembly is then repeatedly coated by dipping into ceramic slurries, followed by stuccoing with ceramic sands to build a ceramic shell mold around the wax pattern. The shell mold is de-waxed in a steam autoclave after the desired shell-wall thickness is attained. Prior to casting, the shell is fired in a heating furnace to develop the strength required to contain the molten metal.
5. The conventional investment casting process remains the only available option for the mass production of gas turbine blades with excellent surface finish. This process, however, suffers from long lead time and high tooling costs.
6. The SC blades of superalloys are currently produced through the well-known Bridgman process

8. Schematic of the LMC process
	The G values achieved with the LMC process are typically double those achieved with the Bridgman process.

10. The achieved G in the front of liquid/solid interface in the GCC process is twice than that in the conventional Bridgman process. The cooling gas must inevitably blow upward into the heating chamber. This effect considerably decreases the furnace temperature and the temperature gradient in the alloy melt, thus negatively affecting the DS/SC process of the components in the shell mold.

11. Stray grains (SGs) are the most serious structural defect in SC castings and cannot be tolerated because they introduce random crystal orientation and the high-angle grain boundaries.
12. SG
	1. When the vertical temperature gradient is insufficient to sustain directional growth, SC transitions to EQ grains, leading to the random nucleation of SGs ahead of the liquid-solid interface.
	2. SGs mainly occur at the extremities of the platform because of the abrupt transition of the crosssection and the rapid cooling of the local melt.
	3. (a) Schematic of the SG formation on the blade platform; (b) the corresponding heat barrier and melt undercooling region
		Crystal growth becomes lateral in the platform region. At the junction between the airfoil and the platform, a heat barrier zone caused by the local poor cooling conditions appears. In this zone, the overheating of the alloy melt is prolonged and blocks SC growth from the airfoil into the undercooled platform.
	![[(a) Schematic of the SG formation on the blade platform; (b) the corresponding heat barrier and melt undercooling region.png|300]]
13. Despite having the same matrix element, Ni-based superalloys may have extremely different undercoolability values. The used alloy is susceptible to SG formation because its low undercoolability value could be easily exceeded by local undercooling.
	[[Ma D, Wu Q, Bührig-Polaczek A. Undercoolability of superalloys and solidi fi cation defects in single crystal components. Advanced Materials Research, 2011, 278: 417 – 422]]
14. Improvement:
	1. Grain continuator technique
		The solidification front will reach the platform before the alloy melt in the extremities becomes undercooled. The bypassed SC orientation can thus be transferred to the platform.
		This technique cannot be employed for the production of casting parts, which require a net shape and cannot be machined.
	2. Heat conductor technique
		+ **Graphite** is used as HC material because of its extremely high thermal conductivity compared with that of the ceramic mold. 
		+ Graphite also has a high emission coefficient, which ensures effective heat radiation into the cold chamber of the Bridgman furnace.
		+ Comparison of simulated temperature development:	![[Comparison of simulated temperature development.png|400]]
	3. Parallel heating and cooling system
	+ During the Bridgman process, the heating and cooling condition is asymmetrical in the cast parts due to different radiation conditions.
	+ Asymmetric temperature distribution and a curved liquid-solid interface
	+ The symmetric heating and cooling provides uniform thermal conditions with the benefitof optimizing microstructures and avoiding solidification defects, increasing G for SC solidification.
	4. Dipping and heaving technology
